                In 2020, Haas driver Romain Grosjean hit the wall on the first lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix. Grosjean hit the metal barrier at a speed of over 140 mph, and the impact should’ve killed him. Grosjean’s car split in two and caught on fire, but the halo cut right through the metal barrier. Grosjean escaped with his life and only minor burns to his hands and feet.

                The next crash the halo impacted was in the 2022 British Grand Prix when Alfa Romeo driver Zhou Guanyu had his car flipped upside down as he traveled at a high speed into the gravel pit and up to the roll cage. Guanyu was upside down for several seconds before he got pinned between the roll cage and the barriers.

                The final crash featured was in 2021 when the heated championship battle between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen reached new heights at the Italian Grand Prix. Both drivers were battling into the first corner when Verstappen’s wheel made contact with Hamilton’s rear wheel. The rotational force caused Verstappen’s car to land on top on Hamilton with Verstappen’s rear wheel landing on Hamilton’s head. The halo did its job and absorbed the weight of an entire car on Hamilton’s head.
